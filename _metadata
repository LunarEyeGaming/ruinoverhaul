  "description" : "^blue;WARNINGS^reset;\nThis mod contains flashing lights and other content that may cause discomfort in people with photosensitive epilepsy.\nThis mod is completely untested in multiplayer; expect a few balancing issues and/or bugs.\n\n^blue;INTRODUCTION^reset;\n\nA few years back, I collaborated in a project that aimed to improve Starbound. Sadly, that project never got off the ground, but a byproduct of this collaboration was the foundation of a mod that aimed to overhaul the Ruin's boss fight. Fueled by the desire to flesh out the Ruin, I decided to develop the mod to its conclusion. This is that mod.\n\nThe Ruin Overhaul mod aims to make the Ruin less of a dragged-out, dull battle by buffing its current attacks and adding new ones to test your skills.\n\nChanges (not comprehensive):\n\n* Reworks the original attacks to be more challenging but fair.\n* Adds some new challenging attacks, along with two brand new phases.\n* Reworks the Asra Nox battle to be much more difficult and moves her into the middle of the fight.\n* Replaces the battle music with \"The Eternal Tide\" as a more fitting track for the battle against the Ruin.\n* Changes the tentacle animation of the Ruin.\n* Adds a biome image for \"hellscape\" (Bobfae swarm).\n* Fixes the light shafts during the death animation not appearing consistently.\n* Adds names and descriptions to all the tentacle monsters.\n* Fixes the hitboxes of the tentacle ghost and tentacle spawner.\n* Adds sound effects to the tentacle ghost.\n\n^blue;COMPATIBILITY^reset;\nIt is compatible with Frackin' Universe.\nIt should also be compatible with my other mods.\nHowever, Supper's Combat Overhaul is likely to cause significant issues with the overhauled Ruin.\n\nThe Ruin Overhaul mod uses patches to make changes to vanilla assets. Each affected asset will have a flag set to indicate that this mod patched that file. See the Workshop description for more details.\n\nAll new assets are prefixed with \"ruin-\" (or \"ruin_\" if the \"-\" is not usable)\nRuin Overhaul's internal name is \"RuinOverhaul\"\n\n^blue;CREDITS^reset;\n\nI would like to thank Portal Mech for playtesting and providing feedback and ideas for the Ruin Overhaul mod. I would also like to thank Ryu Ketsueki and several members of the Starbound Discord server for providing feedback too.\n\nAll custom sounds were made in Audacity using vanilla Starbound's assets",
